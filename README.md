## Fullstack

5. Create a small social network
6. Find a website with public profiles and write a scraper to scrape those profiles
7. Create a realtime video/audio/text chat application

## Frontend/Backend only

If you are applying for a frontend/backend developer position, just implement the frontend/backend for one of the Fullstack challenges.


You have to build this project from scratch i.e. a big chunk of the code cannot come from a similar open source project. 
You may use web frameworks like Python Tornado/Django, Grails, Node on Serverless.com or something similar or it can be a mobile app as well.

Front-end technologies like React, ReactNative, Vue, and TypeScript get you ahead in the queue.
If you are using React use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as a starting 
point.

## *** What are we looking for? ***
1. How creative is your solution?
2. Commit history to see how your work evolved
3. Code quality and best practices
4. Documentation
5. Functionality

These challenges will NOT self-destruct in the next 5 seconds and will be available for you when you are ready. Submit one
and start your interview process with us.
