# Your mission, should you choose to accept it.

Is to submit one of the following projects as a private github or bitbucket
repository. You can share your repo with the username `challengecc`. 
Once you've shared the repository please email us at jobs@causecode.com with the link, cover letter and a resume.

## Fullstack

1. Create a bug or issue tracker
2. Create a chatbot that accepts job applications and stores it in a database
3. Create an application that helps user communicate between any two APIs listed at http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory
4. Create a tiny CRM 
5. Create a small social network
6. Find a website with public profiles and write a scraper to scrape those profiles
7. Create a realtime video/audio/text chat application

## Frontend/Backend only

If you are applying for a frontend/backend developer position, just implement the frontend/backend for one of the Fullstack challenges.


You have to build this project from scratch i.e. a big chunk of the code cannot come from a similar open source project. 
You may use web frameworks like Python Tornado/Django, Grails, Node on Serverless.com or something similar or it can be a mobile app as well.

Front-end technologies like React, ReactNative, Vue, and TypeScript get you ahead in the queue.
If you are using React use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as a starting 
point.

## What are we looking for?
1. How creative is your solution?
2. Commit history to see how your work evolved
3. Code quality and best practices
4. Documentation
5. Functionality

These challenges will NOT self-destruct in the next 5 seconds and will be available for you when you are ready. Submit one
and start your interview process with us.

Good luck.
